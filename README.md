# Let's get Quizzical

This is an upgraded version of the solo challenge "Quizzical" provided by Scrimba.
[Challenge](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/react-section-4-solo-project-co24f49bea8aace7c174082c8).

The Figma design gave an idea of how the application should work. However, I decided to take it up a notch and give the client the ability to choose what type of question they would like to answer as well as the difficulty and topic. In addition, I added a theme toggle that will automatically load dark theme if the client has their browser settings set to dark. Any changes made to the theme via the toggle button will then be saved to local storage and the selected theme will load on their next visit.

### Continued development

The theme I went with was very simple, the purpose of this was to focus more on my react logic and making API calls. For future development, I could take it up a notch by make this app more game-like, meaning more eye catching colors, music and sounds for selecting buttons. I could also add in levels, for example if all easy questions for a category are answered correctly, the client can then move onto the medium questions.
